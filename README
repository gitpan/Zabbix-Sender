NAME
    Zabbix::Sender - A pure-perl implementation of zabbix-sender.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  _init_json
    Zabbix 1.8 uses a JSON encoded payload after a custom Zabbix header. So
    this initializes the JSON object.

  _init_hostname
    The hostname of the sending instance may be given in the constructor.

    If not it is detected here.

  zabbix_template_1_8
    ZABBIX 1.8 TEMPLATE

    a4 - ZBXD b - 0x01 c4 - Length of Request in Bytes (64-bit integer),
    aligned left, padded with 0x00 c4 - dito a* - JSON encoded request

    This may be changed to a HashRef if future version of zabbix change the
    header template.

  _encode_request
    This method encodes the item and value as a json string and creates the
    required header acording to the template defined above.

  _decode_answer
    This method tries to decode the answer received from the server.

  send
    Send the given item with the given value to the server.

    Takes two arguments: item and value. Both should be scalars.

  DEMOLISH
    Disconnects any open sockets on destruction.
